# Product Backlog — Project Initiator

Tag: [Vision → Product]

Last updated: 2025-09-07

## Backlog Overview
This living backlog translates the vision for Project Initiator into prioritized, actionable features. The goal is a static web app (GitHub Pages) that guides developers through thoughtful project planning and generates high-quality, vendor-neutral prompts for coding agents.

**MVP Definition**: Single-page app with core decision checklist, live prompt preview, and copy functionality that helps users think before they build.

- Prompt updates in real-time as user makes selections
- Generated content is vendor-neutral (works across different coding agents)
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality with user feedback
- Generated prompts average 300-800 words (comprehensive but not overwhelming)

### Story 2.4: Local State Persistence
**Priority**: P0  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User selections persist in LocalStorage across browser sessions
- "Reset" button clears all selections and localStorage
- State restoration happens automatically on page load

### Story 3.3: Import/Export Decision Profiles
**Priority**: P1  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Export current selections as JSON file
- Import JSON file to restore exact selections
- JSON schema validation with helpful error messages
- Exported files include metadata (timestamp, app version)
- File naming convention: `project-initiator-profile-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

## Success Metrics Tracking
**Vision Link**: Success Criteria and Initial Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (v0.1)
- **Completion Rate**: 70%+ users reach "Copy prompt" in first session
- **Time to Complete**: Median <5 minutes for default flow
- **Prompt Adoption**: 50%+ of prompts copied at least once
- **User Satisfaction**: "Prompt covered my needs" ≥4.2/5 average

### Measurement Strategy
- Privacy-preserving local analytics (opt-in only)
- Manual UX testing sessions for v0.1
- Post-use survey integration (optional)
- GitHub Pages analytics for traffic patterns

## Risk Mitigation and Trade-offs

### Identified Risks from Vision
1. **Cognitive Overload**: Mitigated by presets, progressive disclosure, sensible defaults
2. **Prompt Quality Variance**: Addressed through structured template format and clear acceptance criteria
3. **Scope Creep**: Bounded by "thinking tool, not scaffolding tool" principle
4. **Privacy vs. Analytics**: Default to local-only, explicit opt-in for telemetry

### Technical Trade-offs
- **Simplicity vs. Functionality**: Starting with core features, progressive enhancement
- **Performance vs. Rich Features**: Static site priority, careful feature addition
- **Vendor Neutrality vs. Convenience**: Core features vendor-neutral, optional vendor-specific add-ons
