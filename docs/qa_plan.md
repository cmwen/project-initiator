Tag: [Product → QA] 

Last updated: 2025-09-07

## Quality Assurance Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach, quality gates, and acceptance criteria validation process for Project Initiator.

---

## Testing Philosophy
- **Privacy-first**: No user data should leave the browser without explicit consent
- **Accessibility-focused**: WCAG AA compliance from the start
- **Performance-aware**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
- **Cross-browser compatible**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works on 375px+ screen widths

## Test Categories and Coverage

### 1. Functional Testing
**Scope**: Core user flows and feature validation

#### 1.1 Decision Checklist Functionality
- [ ] All decision categories render correctly
- [ ] Selections persist across page reloads (LocalStorage)
- [ ] Reset functionality clears all state
- [ ] Progressive disclosure works for complex sections
- [ ] Default selections are sensible and reduce cognitive load

#### 1.2 Prompt Generation
- [ ] Generated prompts follow template structure (Title, Context, Deliverables, Requirements, Assumptions, Acceptance Criteria, Out-of-scope)
- [ ] Real-time updates as user makes selections
- [ ] Vendor-neutral language throughout
- [ ] Generated content length 300-800 words
- [ ] Copy-to-clipboard works with user feedback

#### 1.3 State Management
- [ ] LocalStorage persistence across sessions
- [ ] State restoration on page load
- [ ] No data transmission without user action
- [ ] URL encoding/decoding for shareable links (P1 feature)

### 2. Performance Testing
**Acceptance Criteria from Backlog**:
- [ ] Time to Interactive (TTI) < 1s on typical broadband
- [ ] Lighthouse performance ≥90 desktop, ≥85 mobile
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] Efficient re-rendering on state updates

### 3. Accessibility Testing
**WCAG AA Compliance**:
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet AA standards
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (test with NVDA/VoiceOver)
- [ ] Focus management for dynamic content
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Alt text for all meaningful images
- [ ] Form labels and descriptions

### 4. Browser Compatibility
**Supported Browsers**:
- [ ] Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Firefox (latest 2 versions)  
- [ ] Safari (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Edge (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### 5. Security Testing
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content generation
- [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage or URLs
- [ ] Content Security Policy implementation
- [ ] No external dependencies with security risks

## Quality Gates by Epic

### Epic 1: Repository Scaffolding
**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] All documentation files are accessible and properly linked
- [ ] Build process produces clean, deployable static assets
- [ ] CI pipeline runs without errors
- [ ] No linting or code quality issues

### Epic 2: Core MVP Features
**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] All Story 2.1-2.4 acceptance criteria pass functional testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (TTI < 1s)
- [ ] No console errors in any supported browser
- [ ] LocalStorage functionality tested across browser restarts

### Epic 3: User Experience Enhancements  
**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Preset templates produce valid, useful prompts
- [ ] Shareable URLs work reliably across different devices/browsers
- [ ] Import/export maintains data integrity with schema validation

## Testing Tools and Automation

### Development Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Jest for utility functions and state management
- **Integration Testing**: Testing Library for user interaction flows
- **Build Testing**: Automated builds on CI to catch static generation issues

### Quality Assurance Tools
- **Lighthouse CI**: Automated performance and accessibility auditing
- **axe-core**: Accessibility testing integration
- **Cross-browser testing**: Manual testing protocol for supported browsers
- **Load testing**: Basic performance under typical usage patterns

### Manual Testing Protocols

#### Pre-release Checklist
1. **Smoke Test** (5 minutes):
   - Load app in clean browser state
   - Make selections in each category
   - Generate and copy prompt
   - Verify localStorage persistence

2. **User Flow Test** (15 minutes):
   - Complete preset selection flow
   - Modify preset and generate custom prompt
   - Test reset and state restoration
   - Verify mobile responsive behavior

3. **Cross-browser Test** (20 minutes):
   - Run smoke test in each supported browser
   - Verify consistent behavior and appearance
   - Test copy-to-clipboard across browsers

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

### Severity Classification
- **P0 (Critical)**: App doesn't load or core functionality broken
- **P1 (High)**: Key feature doesn't work as specified
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor functionality issue or poor UX
- **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic issue or edge case

### Bug Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**: Manual testing, user feedback, or automated checks
2. **Triage**: Assign severity and priority
3. **Fix**: Development and unit testing
4. **Verification**: QA validation against acceptance criteria
5. **Closure**: Confirm fix in production environment

---

## Success Metrics Validation

### User Experience Metrics (Manual Collection for v0.1)
- **Task Completion Rate**: % users who successfully generate and copy a prompt
- **Time to Completion**: Average time from first interaction to copied prompt
- **Error Rate**: % of sessions with JavaScript errors or broken functionality
- **User Satisfaction**: Post-use survey ratings

### Technical Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Speed**: Lighthouse performance scores
- **Accessibility Score**: Lighthouse accessibility audit results
- **Browser Compatibility**: % of supported browsers with zero critical issues

---

## Test Data and Scenarios

### Representative User Scenarios
1. **New Indie Developer**: Wants to build a CLI tool, needs guidance on publishing to npm
2. **Enterprise Developer**: Building internal web app, needs CI/CD and testing setup
3. **Open Source Maintainer**: Creating new library, needs comprehensive documentation setup
4. **Student/Educator**: Learning prompt engineering, needs clear examples

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Empty or minimal selections (should still generate valid prompt)
- Maximum complexity selections (all advanced options enabled)
- LocalStorage quotas exceeded or unavailable
- JavaScript disabled scenarios
- Very slow network conditions
- Small screen sizes (320px width)

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Collection
- GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- Optional anonymous usage feedback collection
- Manual user testing sessions during development

### Quality Metrics Review
- Weekly review of automated test results
- Monthly review of user feedback and satisfaction scores
- Quarterly review of performance and accessibility benchmarks
