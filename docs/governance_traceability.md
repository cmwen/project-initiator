## Change Impact Analysis

### Change Request Template
When making changes to any document, assess impact across all linked documents:

1. **Vision Changes**: Update product backlog priorities, design constraints, QA requirements
2. **Product Changes**: Update design decisions, implementation plan, test cases
3. **Design Changes**: Update QA requirements, implementation approach, acceptance criteria
4. **Implementation Changes**: Update QA validation, progress tracking, risk assessment

## Risk and Dependency Tracking

### Cross-Document Dependencies

| Dependency | From | To | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Pages Constraints** | Vision → Product → Design | Low | DD-001 documents limitations |
| **Performance Requirements** | Vision → Product → QA | Medium | Automated testing planned |
| **Privacy-first Approach** | Vision → Design → QA | Low | Security testing covers this |
| **User Research Validation** | Product → Execution | Medium | Manual testing protocol established |
