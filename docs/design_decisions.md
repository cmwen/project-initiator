## DD-001: Static Site Architecture with GitHub Pages
**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Decided  
**Product Link**: [Product Backlog Epic 1, Epic 2.1]

### Context
Need to choose hosting and architecture approach for the Project Initiator web application.

### Decision
Build as a static single-page application hosted on GitHub Pages with no backend dependencies.

### Rationale
- **Cost**: GitHub Pages is free for public repositories
- **Privacy**: Client-side only ensures no user data leaves browser
- **Simplicity**: No server management or backend complexity
- **Performance**: Static assets load quickly and cache well
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Independent of cloud providers

### Consequences
- ✅ Fast, secure, privacy-friendly
- ✅ Easy deployment and maintenance
- ❌ Limited to client-side functionality only
- ❌ No server-side analytics or data collection
- ❌ Cannot integrate with APIs requiring server-side secrets

### Implementation Notes
- Use build tools (Vite) for development experience while outputting static assets
- Leverage LocalStorage for state persistence
- Consider service worker for offline functionality in later versions
